**Android Malware Detection Project**
This project aims to detect Android malware using data science techniques on a Kaggle dataset with 16,000 records and 215 attributes.

Key Steps
Data Collection: Loaded datasets using pd.read_csv().
Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned data (handled missing values with dropna())
Transformed data (label encoding, normalization)
Visualization: Used histograms, bar plots, and heat maps to explore data.
Feature Selection: Applied chi-square tests to select top features.
Dimensionality Reduction: Used PCA to reduce variables.
Modeling: Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, trained various machine learning models.
Libraries Used
Python: pandas, NumPy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn
Jupyter Notebook, Google Collab: For coding and visualization

Outcome:
Achieved effective malware detection through structured preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.

Conclusion:
Demonstrated comprehensive data science application for Android malware detection, highlighting the importance of preprocessing, feature selection, and model training.
